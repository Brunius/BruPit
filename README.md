# BruPit

A flight simulator project.

BruPit started because I went _"Gosh, Cougar MFDs are expensive for what you get"_. Since then it's grown, much more than I expected it to. I never expected to need to do proper software engineer stuff like sequence diagrams and READMEs. This repository is organised as best I can; I think it's fairly clear where stuff is, but I may be wrong. In short:

## ECAD

Contains _electrical_ CAD items. These are Circuit Diagrams and PCB layouts. All items are designed with kicad.

## MCAD

Contains _mechanical_ CAD items. These are mostly enclosures for stuff. All items are designed with Solidworks (sorry, FreeCAD - I love you, but I really wanted an assembly workbench).

## Programs

Contains the software you need. These are intended to be loaded using the Arduino IDE, though other IDEs may work.

## Documentation

Contains any documentation, mostly surrounding the software. This is stuff you _shouldn't_ need as a home user, but might want if you're modifying the software.
